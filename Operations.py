# A simple program to perform addition and subtraction on two numbers

# Read input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Performing addition and subtraction
sum_result = num1 + num2
diff_result = num1 - num2

# Displaying the results
print("Performing addition and subtraction")
print("Results:")
print("Addition (num1 + num2) =", sum_result)
print("Subtraction (num1 - num2) =", diff_result)
